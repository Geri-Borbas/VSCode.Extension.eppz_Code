# eppz! Code
## **C# theme for Unity!** Carefully designed colors with meanings.


### Main features

* **Colors have meanings** for instant read (Adjective, Subject, Verb, Noun)
* Comforting yet **distinctive** colors (Types, Variables, Functions, Literals)
* **Syntax coloring additions** (C# language grammar extensions)
    + Unity classes (`UnityEngine`, `UnityEditor`)
    + Regions (`using`, `namespace`, Attributes, XML Documentation)


### Known-issues

* Don't match multi-line Attribute regions
* Unity classes within literals also
